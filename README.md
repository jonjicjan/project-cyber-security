# 🤖 Machine Learning Classification Platform

A powerful and user-friendly web application for data analysis, model training, and classification predictions built with Streamlit. This platform allows users to upload their datasets, perform exploratory data analysis, train multiple machine learning models, and make predictions using the best-performing model.

## ✨ Features

### 📊 Data Analysis
- Upload and analyze CSV datasets
- Automatic data preprocessing
- Interactive data visualization
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Class distribution plots
- Missing value analysis
- Basic statistics and data overview

### 🎯 Model Training
- Support for multiple classification algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naïve Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- Automatic model comparison
- Performance metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
- Progress tracking during training
- Best model selection and persistence

### 🔮 Prediction

## 📖 Usage Guide

### 1. Data Upload
- Navigate to "Upload & Train" section
- Upload your CSV file
- The file should contain:
  - Feature columns (numerical)
  - A 'type' column for classification labels

### 2. Model Training
- After uploading data, the application will:
  - Show data statistics and visualizations
  - Train multiple models
  - Display performance comparisons
  - Save the best performing model

### 3. Making Predictions
- Go to the "Prediction" section
- Enter feature values
- Click "Predict" to get classification results
- View prediction probabilities (if available)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Data Preprocessing
- Automatic handling of missing values
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Label encoding for target variable

### Model Selection
- Trains multiple classification models
- Automatically selects the best performing model
- Uses cross-validation for reliable performance estimation

### Performance Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision (weighted average)
- Recall (weighted average)
- F1 Score (weighted average)
